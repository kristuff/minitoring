# URL rewriting 
# -------------

# If the following conditions are true, then rewrite the URL:
# If the requested filename is not a directory,
# and if the requested filename is not a regular file that exists,
# and if the requested filename is not a symbolic link,
# then rewrite the URL in the following way:
# Take the whole request filename and provide it as the value of a
# "url" query parameter to index.php. Append any query string from
# the original URL as further query parameters (QSA), and stop
# processing this .htaccess file (L).
